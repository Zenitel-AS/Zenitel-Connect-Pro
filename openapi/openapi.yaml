  title: Zenitel Link interface
  description: |
    **Zenitel Link** is composed of two different interfaces:
    1. REST interface for requesting information, and initiating call or device operations.
    2. WAMP (wamp-proto.org) interface that offer the same, but also event subscription to system events in addition.

    Most of the REST operations will result in one or more system events through the WAMP interface.
    There are events published at changes in call progress, call queue changes, door opened etc.
    Please see section **Events** and **Trace** buttons below for event defintions.
    It is possible to poll information using the REST interface, but it is way more efficient to subscribe to the WAMP events.
    The REST interface is a wrapper for the WAMP interface, hence, every REST operation has a WAMP counterpart which can be used directly.

    **How to Use:**

    Use the **'Authorize'** button, under **oAuth2Password (OAuth2, password)**
    type username as **client_id**, password as **client_secret** and click Authorize

                    In order to login and start using Zenitel Link, the external application
                    first needs to send a login request using this URI.
                    The username and password are encrypted as Base64 using standard HTTP Basic Access Authentication (Authorization: Basic xxxxx).
                    Upon successful login, the encrypted string 'access_token' is returned, and this must then be included
                    in the HTTP header as 'Authorization: Bearer xxxx' token for all other following requests."
